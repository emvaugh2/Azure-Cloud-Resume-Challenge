# Azure Cloud Resume Challenge

**Alright I'm starting this challenge over from scratch because I don't remember it. Lets take it on a day-by-day basis.**

* Steps 1 - X

Chunk 1: Building the Frontend

Step 6 - Azure DNS

We're going to update all of this momentarily. 

Step 5 - HTTPS

We need to make sure our website is using HTTPS for a secure connection. We'll use Azure CDN for this. I know this is Azure Content Delivery Network. I need to go back over exactly what this is used for although I know it makes your content easily assessible to users across the globe because it distributes the content at a location nearest to the user. I still have to review the HTTPS part. 

Step 4 - Static Website

Now we have to deploy our code to a static webpage in Azure. I kind of alreayd had this set up as well. You have to go to your storage account in the Overview blade, you have to go to Capabilities and then select Static website. Here, you can find the link to your Static website with your `index.html` file. I already uploaded the HTML and CSS files to my `$web` container in my blob storage so when you copy the primary endpoint and paste it in your URL, it should take you to your Static webpage. 

Step 2 & 3 - HTML & CSS

I need to write some HTML code for this portion to work. I've already done this but I really need to update my resume so I'm going to take the time to do that now. 

I had to go back over a refresher for HTML to see which parts I wanted to edit. I had to update my work experience which was pretty much copy and paste but I also had to realign my bullet points. I edited the bullet point placement in my CSS file. I was also encountering some weird issue where my LinkedIn Profile and my GItHub repo link wouldn't be on separate lines so I went ahead and used `<br>` to break them apart. I had to use a ton of `&nbsp` to space out the text though. My HTML code is so ugly. 

But it works. 




Step 1 - Azure Certification

The first step of this project is to get an Azure certification. I have two Azure certifications: AZ - 900 and AZ - 104 so I'm definitely done with this portion of the project. I will be periodically reviewing the AZ - 104 labs and going into the AZ - 305 labs as well as the AZ - 700 course but that will be later. 

Step completed!
